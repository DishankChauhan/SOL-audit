# Sol Audit Program Deployment Report

## Program Details

- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Program ID**: J2M7TVwpdcCz6s8aCTPQxkcgQiGXdn9nhZyKynStjRD4
- **Deployment Keypair**: new-program-keypair.json
- **Deployment Date**: `Date.now()`

## Program Architecture

This Solana program implements a bounty system for security audits with the following key features:

1. **Account Structure**:
   - Bounty Account (PDA): Stores bounty metadata (creator, hunter, amount, deadline, status)
   - Vault Account (PDA): Holds the locked SOL for each bounty

2. **Native SOL Operations**:
   - Uses direct SOL transfers instead of SPL tokens
   - Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure fund management

3. **Instructions**:
   - `CreateBounty`: Creator creates a bounty and locks SOL in the vault
   - `SubmitWork`: Hunter submits work (optional, mainly for logging)
   - `ApproveSubmission`: Creator approves a hunter's submission
   - `ClaimBounty`: Approved hunter claims SOL reward
   - `CancelBounty`: Creator cancels bounty after deadline and reclaims SOL

## Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated to use the new Program ID:
- Updated `env.ts` with the new Program ID: J2M7TVwpdcCz6s8aCTPQxkcgQiGXdn9nhZyKynStjRD4

## How to Upgrade

If you need to upgrade the program in the future, use the following command:

```
solana program deploy --program-id new-program-keypair.json target/deploy/audit_bounty.so
```

Make sure to use the same keypair (new-program-keypair.json) for deployment upgrades.

## Testing

To test the deployed program, you can use the frontend application or directly interact with the program using the Solana CLI or JavaScript SDK.
