## üî≠ Overview

Sol Audit is a decentralized platform built on Solana that connects smart contract developers with top security auditors. Our platform streamlines the entire audit process, from bounty creation to vulnerability disclosure and reward distribution.

**Mission:** Make smart contract security accessible and reliable for all blockchain developers.

![Bounty Creation Flow](docs/images/bounty-creation.png)

## ü§î Why Sol Audit?

### Problems in the Current Audit Landscape

- **High Costs:** Traditional audit firms charge premium prices, making security inaccessible for smaller projects
- **Limited Availability:** Top auditors have long waitlists, delaying project launches
- **Centralized Control:** Existing bounty platforms lack transparency and on-chain settlement
- **Misaligned Incentives:** Fixed-fee audits don't reward based on actual vulnerabilities found
- **Poor User Experience:** Current solutions have complex workflows and poor developer experience

### Our Solution

Sol Audit addresses these challenges by:

1. **Pay-Per-Finding Model:** Only pay for actual vulnerabilities discovered
2. **On-Chain Settlement:** All rewards are processed transparently on Solana
3. **Open Marketplace:** Any qualified auditor can participate, reducing wait times
4. **Enhanced Security:** Leveraging the collective expertise of diverse security researchers
5. **Seamless UX:** Intuitive platform designed for both developers and auditors
