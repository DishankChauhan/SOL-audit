## 🔭 Overview

Sol Audit is a decentralized platform built on Solana that connects smart contract developers with top security auditors. Our platform streamlines the entire audit process, from bounty creation to vulnerability disclosure and reward distribution.

**Mission:** Make smart contract security accessible and reliable for all blockchain developers.

![Bounty Creation Flow](docs/images/bounty-creation.png)

## 🤔 Why Sol Audit?

### Problems in the Current Audit Landscape

- **High Costs:** Traditional audit firms charge premium prices, making security inaccessible for smaller projects
- **Limited Availability:** Top auditors have long waitlists, delaying project launches
- **Centralized Control:** Existing bounty platforms lack transparency and on-chain settlement
- **Misaligned Incentives:** Fixed-fee audits don't reward based on actual vulnerabilities found
- **Poor User Experience:** Current solutions have complex workflows and poor developer experience

### Our Solution

Sol Audit addresses these challenges by:

1. **Pay-Per-Finding Model:** Only pay for actual vulnerabilities discovered
2. **On-Chain Settlement:** All rewards are processed transparently on Solana
3. **Open Marketplace:** Any qualified auditor can participate, reducing wait times
4. **Enhanced Security:** Leveraging the collective expertise of diverse security researchers
5. **Seamless UX:** Intuitive platform designed for both developers and auditors

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

We're committed to continually improving the Sol Audit platform. Here's what's coming next:

### Short-term (Q2 2023)
- **Dispute Resolution DAO** - Implement a decentralized arbitration system for contested submissions
- **Enhanced Analytics** - Provide insights for both auditors and project owners
- **Reputation System** - Build a trustless reputation system for auditors based on successful findings

### Mid-term (Q3-Q4 2023)
- **Team Collaboration** - Support for audit teams working together on larger projects
- **Specialized Audit Types** - Custom templates for different types of audits (NFT, DeFi, etc.)
- **Integration with Developer Tools** - IDE plugins and CI/CD integrations

### Long-term Vision
- **Decentralized Governance** - Community-driven platform governance
- **Cross-chain Support** - Extend beyond Solana to other blockchain ecosystems
- **Audit Certification Program** - Standardized certification for auditors on the platform

## Testing the Bounty Flow on Localnet

The project includes tools to test the complete bounty workflow on localnet. This is particularly useful for testing the escrow payment flow without connecting to devnet or mainnet.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the Solana localnet validator is running:
   ```bash
   solana-test-validator
   ```

2. Deploy the program to localnet if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   cd audit_bounty
   solana program deploy target/deploy/audit_bounty.so
   ```

3. Update the program ID in `/src/lib/env.ts` to match your deployed program if needed.

### Running the Test Flow

1. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd audit-bounty-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/debug/localnet-test-flow

3. Follow the steps in the UI to:
   - Fund test wallets
   - Create a bounty
   - Submit audit work
   - Approve the submission
   - Claim the bounty

### Troubleshooting Network Issues

If you encounter payment flow issues, check the following:

1. **Network Mismatch**: The most common issue is mixing different networks. The Phantom wallet typically connects to devnet/mainnet which will cause transaction failures when your contract is on localnet. Use the localnet test flow for consistent network usage.

2. **Bounty Status**: The bounty must be in "Approved" status before it can be claimed. The creator must approve a submission first.

3. **Wallet Authorization**: The wallet claiming the bounty must be the same one that was approved by the creator.

4. **Transaction Logs**: Check the browser console logs for detailed transaction errors and status updates.

### Local Wallet Testing

The project includes a local wallet implementation for testing without external wallets:

- Test keypairs are pre-generated in `src/lib/solana/localWallet.ts`
- The `createLocalWallet` function creates a mock wallet context that can sign transactions
- Use `fundTestWallet` to add SOL to test wallets via localnet airdrops

Example:
```typescript
import { createLocalWallet, fundTestWallet } from '@/lib/solana/localWallet';

// Create a local wallet with creator role
const creatorWallet = createLocalWallet('creator');

// Fund it with 5 SOL
await fundTestWallet('creator', 5);

// Use it to interact with the contract
const result = await SolanaService.initializeBounty(creatorWallet, {...});
```
